How to run:
	1. To run the assignment build the entire 'Secret-octo-ironman' workspace
	2. Run simplegame.

To build:
	1. To build: Enter the directory of the project. $ ./configure 	$ make $ make install

Aim of the game:
	The aim of our game is to collect coin cubes with the player cube. The player starts with 15 health.
	If the player collides with the environment or an enemy cube, 1 health is lost. The game is over when all health is lost.

Controls:
	LSHIFT      : 	move forward 1 space
	LCTRL       : 	move backward 1 space
	LEFT ARROW  :	move left 1 space
	RIGHT ARROW :	move right 1 space
	UP ARROW    :	move up 1 space
	DOWN ARROW  :	move down 1 space

Known Bugs:
	The cube 'collides' with air near the middle of the game space causing the cube to lose all 15health instantanouesly, 
	thus ending the game.

Future Changes:
	Fix 'air collision' and fix proper collisions with the collect asset. Have an enemy cube move around game space to 
	increase difficulty.
